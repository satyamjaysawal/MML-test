Running a Flask app in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) involves several steps. Here's a guide to help you get started:

1. **Install Python**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from python.org.

2. **Install VS Code**:
   Download and install Visual Studio Code from code.visualstudio.com.

3. **Install the Python Extension**:
   Open VS Code and install the Python extension from the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X), searching for "Python".

4. **Create a Project Folder**:
   Create a new folder for your Flask project. Open this folder in VS Code by navigating to the folder in a terminal and running:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

5. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   In the terminal within VS Code, create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

6. **Install Flask**:
   With the virtual environment activated, install Flask:
   ```bash
   pip install flask
   ```

7. **Create a Flask App**:
   Create a new file named `app.py` in your project folder and add the following code:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/')
   def home():
       return "Hello, Flask!"

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```

8. **Run the Flask App**:
   In the terminal, run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   This will start the Flask development server. You can view your app by navigating to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

9. **Debugging in VS Code**:
   To debug your Flask app, create a `launch.json` file in the `.vscode` folder with the following configuration:
   ```json
   {
       "version": "0.2.0",
       "configurations": [
           {
               "name": "Python: Flask",
               "type": "python",
               "request": "launch",
               "module": "flask",
               "env": {
                   "FLASK_APP": "app.py",
                   "FLASK_ENV": "development"
               },
               "args": [
                   "run",
                   "--no-debugger",
                   "--no-reload"
               ],
               "jinja": true
           }
       ]
   }
   ```
   Start debugging by pressing `F5`.
